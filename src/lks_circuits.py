#                  (Low, Kliuchnikov, Schaeffer 2018). Improves the bounds on our basic 
#                  highly-sequential circuit, but only gives big-O notation instead of
#                  actual quantities. It also does not provide Clifford counts, but we typically
#                  assume these will not affect the overall cost much anyways.
